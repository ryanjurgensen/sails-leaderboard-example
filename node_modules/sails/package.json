  "readme": "Sails\n====\n\nSails is designed to resemble Ruby on Rails with its MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and convention-over-configuration philosophy. Like Node.JS, Sails.JS written in JavaScript, the language most developers are already using. Sails provides a familiar framework for custom apps which cuts development to a fraction of the time.\n\nSails does a few things other MVC frameworks can't do:\n- Sails provides all the productivity benefits of Ruby on Rails, but with the realtime capabilities and asynchronous efficiency of Node.js; all in the same language we're already using, JavaScript.\n- Sails routes Socket.io messages the same way as HTTP requests through Express.  When dealing with a Socket.io-initiated request, Sails transparently overrides Express' request and response objects to allow your code to be transport-agnostic.semantics (`res.send`).  This enables a consistent development interface and keeps you from having to reinvent the wheel just to share logic between Express and Socket.io.\n- Sails also contains built-in authentication and role-based access control.  As it should, this works the same way for Socket.io messages as it does for Express requests. (See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-example)\n\n\nInstallation\n--\n```npm install sails```\n\nOr to install with the command line tool:\n```sudo npm install -g sails```\n\nGetting Started\n--\nIf you installed Sails with the command line tool above, the following command will generate a new Sails project, ```nameOfNewApp/```, in the current directory:\n\n```sails nameOfNewApp```\n\nThen run the app:\n```\ncd nameOfNewApp\nnode app.js\n```\n\nExample\n--\nhttps://github.com/balderdashy/sails-example\n\nDependencies and Compatibility\n--\n\nTested with node 0.8.1\n\nWe built Sails on the rock-solid foundations of ExpressJS, Sequelize ORM, and Socket.io.  \n\n\n## Who Built This?\nThe Sails framework is jointly developed and supported by Mike McNeil and Balderdash Design Co.  Balderdash builds realtime web apps as a service, and after much frustration with the lack of convention in existing solutions, we built Sails to use on our customers' projects.  Naturally, we open-sourced it.  Hopefully, it makes your life a little bit easier!\n\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n--\n\nCopyright © 2012 Mike McNeil\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Rigging
====

Rigging is an asset manager for Node.js, designed specifically for the Sails framework.  It uses great open-source plugins that already exist to allow for:

- CSS minification
- Javascript minification
- Retina display downsizing and thumbnail generation (coming soon, see https://github.com/balderdashy/deretina)
- Automatic spritesheet compilation (coming soon)
- Conditional serving of images based on screen size (coming soon)

Installation
--
```npm install rigging```


Compatibility
--
Tested with node 0.6.4 up to node 0.8.1


## Who Built This?
The Sails framework, including Mast, Rigging, and other related packages, are jointly developed and supported by Mike McNeil and Balderdash Design Co.  Balderdashs build wonderful web apps as a service, and after much frustration, we built Sails to use on our customers' projects.  Naturally, we open-sourced it.  Hopefully, it makes your life a little bit easier!

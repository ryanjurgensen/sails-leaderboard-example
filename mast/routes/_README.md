routes

These files are only imported if Mast is enabled.

Mast routes are the client-side equivalent of 'controllers.'  

They resolve #fragment and HTML5 history bookmark resolution, the hashchange event, and Mast.navigate() calls.
They can also be mapped to handle server-side events over the Socket.
